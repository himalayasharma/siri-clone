The project involved recording 4-second monophonic audio clips in wav format, containing questions. These audio clips were then transcribed into text using AssemblyAI's API. The next step was to utilize OpenAI's API, which had a GPT-3 backend (Davinci variant), to generate answers. The length of the answers was capped at 100 tokens to ensure conciseness and clarity. The objective was to utilize cutting-edge technology to efficiently transcribe audio into text and generate concise answers to questions.
